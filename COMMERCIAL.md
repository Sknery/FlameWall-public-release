For **commercial use**, we offer flexible licensing options.  
Don't want to set it up yourself? **Installation services available** starting at $100.

---

## 🆓 What's FREE (AGPL v3)

✅ **Run for your own Minecraft server** (community/hobby)  
✅ **Self-host** for your players  
✅ **Modify** for your own needs  
✅ **Contribute** improvements back to the project  
✅ **Study** and learn from the code  

**No license needed. Just follow AGPL v3 terms.**

## 💰 When You Need a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if you want to:

❌ **Sell or resell** FlameWall as a product  
❌ **Offer as SaaS** or managed hosting service (Hosting Provider License)  
❌ **White-label** and rebrand without attribution  
❌ **Keep modifications private** (not share source code)  
❌ **Create closed-source plugins/extensions** for sale  
❌ **Integrate with proprietary systems** without open-sourcing your integration code

**Important:** Under AGPL v3, if you modify FlameWall and provide it as a service over a network, you **must** release your modifications as open source. Commercial licenses allow you to keep your code private.

### 🐳 Hosting Provider / OEM License
**Enterprise Pricing: Contact for Quote (Starts at $5,000/year)**

**Target Audience:** Hosting Companies, Game Server Hosts (Tebex, etc.), Cloud Providers, SaaS Platforms

**When You Need This License:**

If you intend to:
- Offer FlameWall as a managed service to your customers
- Monetize access to FlameWall instances (SaaS)
- Wrap FlameWall in a proprietary container/panel without releasing your source code
- Integrate FlameWall with your billing system while keeping integration code private
- Resell FlameWall as part of a larger hosting package

**Why AGPL v3 Requires This:**

Under the standard AGPL v3 license, any service provider modifying the code or integrating it into a proprietary stack **must release their full source code** publicly. This includes:
- Your billing integration code
- Your panel/container modifications
- Your proprietary infrastructure code

**This license waives AGPL requirements**, allowing you to:
- ✅ Keep your backend modifications private
- ✅ Keep billing integrations closed-source
- ✅ Offer FlameWall as a paid service without source disclosure
- ✅ Host for unlimited customers
- ✅ Access to updates (when available)
- ✅ Email support (7-14 business days response, best effort)

- **Revenue Share Option:** Available for large providers (contact to discuss)
- **Multi-Year Discounts:** Available for 2+ year commitments

**Important:** This is a passive income project. I maintain it in my free time. No SLA, no guaranteed response times. This license is designed to protect my work from corporate exploitation while allowing legitimate hosting providers to operate.

## 🛡️ License Compliance

**I respect the open source community.**

If you're using FlameWall for free under AGPL v3, I'll never force you to buy a license.

However, if you're violating AGPL v3 (selling without sharing source, offering SaaS without disclosure), I will:

1. Reach out privately first (may take a while, I'm one person)
2. Offer to sell you a proper license
3. If you refuse: DMCA takedown + public disclosure

**Just be honest. I'm a reasonable person, but I will enforce the license.**
